# accept-guard

Interface/port access control by wrapping the accept system call in Linux.

The accept guard wrapper will allow accesses based on a list of
interfaces and ports.  It is preloaded using the LD_PRELOAD environment
variable, and access is controlled by the environment variable ACL.

ACL environment variable syntax:

```
<rule>[;<rule>]
where rule obeys:
<interface>:<port>[,<port>]...
```

- If interface is defined as `any`, access will be allowed on all
  interfaces on the listed ports.
- If used, it is expected to be the first and only interface entry for
  the same port, since the accept call will be allowed based on the
  first matching rule.

## Example

An example script to start mongoose webserver and limit access to port
80 for interface `eth2`, port 443 for interface `eth3` and allow both
ports on interface `eth4`:

```
#!/bin/sh
export LD_PRELOAD=/lib/access-guard.so
export ACL="eth2:80;eth3:443;eth4:80,443"
exec /bin/mongoose /etc/mongoose/config 
```
